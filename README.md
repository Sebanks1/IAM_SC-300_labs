# 🛡️SC-300 Identity and Access Administrator Labs

This repo tracks my hands-on progress through SC-300 labs as I focus on building skills in Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD). Each lab includes a summary and video walkthrough.

### 💻 Enabled and configured Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)  
**What I did:**
Enabled and configured Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) in Microsoft Entra ID, assigned it to a test group, and validated the end-user password reset process to support secure and efficient account recovery.

## 🔐 Priviledge Access Management

### 💻 Assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
**What I did:**
Assigned Azure resource roles using Privileged Identity Management (PIM), set up eligible assignments, configured just-in-time (JIT) access with MFA, and tested role activation to enforce least privilege across Azure resources.

### 💻 Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Microsoft Entra roles
**What I did:**
Configured Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Microsoft Entra roles by setting up eligible role assignments, enforcing MFA, adding approval workflows, and defining activation settings to limit standing access and support least privilege.
