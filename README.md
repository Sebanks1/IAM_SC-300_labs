# 🛡️SC-300 Identity and Access Administrator Labs

This repo tracks my hands-on progress through SC-300 labs as I focus on building skills in Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD). Each lab includes a summary and video walkthrough.

## 🔐 Authentication & Access Control Labs

### 💻 Lab – Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
**What I did:**  
Set up MFA for users in Microsoft Entra to improve identity security with an extra layer of protection.

### 💻 Enabled and configured Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)  
**What I did:**
Enabled and configured Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) in Microsoft Entra ID, assigned it to a test group, and validated the end-user password reset process to support secure and efficient account recovery.

### 💻 Enabled user risk and sign-in risk policies  
**What I did:**
I configured and enabled user risk and sign-in risk policies in Microsoft Entra to automatically trigger password resets and MFA based on detected identity threats.

### 💻 Implement and Test a Conditional Access Policy 
**What I did:**
I created and tested a Conditional Access policy in Azure Entra ID that blocked user access to a specific application based on defined conditions.

## 🔐 Priviledge Access Management

### 💻 Assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
**What I did:**
Assigned Azure resource roles using Privileged Identity Management (PIM), set up eligible assignments, configured just-in-time (JIT) access with MFA, and tested role activation to enforce least privilege across Azure resources.

### 💻 Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Microsoft Entra roles
**What I did:**
Configured Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Microsoft Entra roles by setting up eligible role assignments, enforcing MFA, adding approval workflows, and defining activation settings to limit standing access and support least privilege.

## 🔐 Federation & App Access (SAML_OpenID_OAuth 2.0)

### 💻 Add a Federated Identity Provider
**What I did:**
Configured Azure AD to add a federated identity provider by connecting an external service (like Google), setting up Azure AD B2C settings, and enabling conditional access for external users.

### 💻 Register an application
**What I did:**
Registered an application in Azure AD (Entra ID) by specifying redirect URIs, selecting supported account types, and capturing the application and directory IDs to enable secure authentication and API access.

---

### 💻 Grant tenant-wide admin consent to an application
**What I did:**
Granted tenant-wide admin consent to an application in Azure AD (Entra ID) by reviewing requested permissions, approving consent on behalf of all users, and verifying that the app could access organizational data without prompting individual users.

📺 [Watch the walkthrough](https://youtu.be/h12WoZ_TXH8?si=Ob1EUIs5qfpDb_s8)

---

### 💻 Implement access management for apps
**What I did:**
Implemented access management for apps in Azure AD (Entra ID) by assigning users and groups to applications, configuring app roles, and applying user consent and access review settings to control and monitor application access.

## 🔐 Identity Governance & Access Reviews

### 💻 Create and manage a catalog of resources in Microsoft Entra entitlement management
**What I did:**
Created and managed a catalog of resources in Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management by setting up access packages, defining resource roles, and organizing groups, apps, and Saleforce sites into a catalog to support automated access requests and governance.
